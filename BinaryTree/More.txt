###it's about implementing BinaryTree operatons with C++ including:

1. how to create a binary tree(with recursion)
2. four ways of traversal using recursion and non-recursion
	* preorder traversal
	* inorder traversal
	* postorder traversal
	* level traversal
3. get the size and depth of the binary tree
4. get k level size and print nodes of this level
5. get how many leaf nodes are
